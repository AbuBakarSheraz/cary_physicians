                  All copayments, deductibles, patient responsibility amounts, and past-due balances are due at the time of check-in unless previous arrangements have been made with our billing coordinator.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  We accept payment by cash, check, VISA, and MasterCard. We will only accept post-dated checks when they are provided within an approved payment plan.

                <p className="mb-4">
                  If your insurance plan requires a referral authorization from your primary care physician or a pre-authorization from your insurance, you will need to contact your primary care physician or insurance company to be sure it has been obtained. If we have yet to receive authorization prior to your appointment time, we will reschedule.. Failure to obtain the referral or preauthorization may result in a lower or no payment from the insurance company, and the balance will become the patientâs responsibility.

                <p className="mb-4">
                Insurance is a contract between you and your insurance company. In most cases, we are not a party to this contract. We will bill your primary insurance company on your behalf as a courtesy to you. To properly bill your insurance company, we require that you disclose all insurance information, including primary and secondary insurance, as well as any change of insurance information. 

It is your responsibility to notify our office promptly of any patient information changes (ie, address, name, insurance information) to facilitate appropriate billing for the services rendered to you. Failure to provide complete and accurate insurance information may result in the entire bill being categorized as a patientâs responsibility. 

Although we may estimate what your insurance company may pay, it is the insurance company that makes the final determination of your eligibility and benefits. If your insurance company is not contracted with us, you agree to pay any portion of the charges not covered by insurance, including but not limited to those charges above the usual and customary allowance. If we are out of network for your insurance company and your insurance pays you directly, you are responsible for payment and agree to forward the payment to us immediately.

                <p className="mb-4">
                Cary Physicians Primary Care PLLC accepts most major insurance plans. However, with the frequent changes that happen in the insurance marketplace, it is a good idea for you to contact your insurance company prior to your appointment and verify if we are a participating provider as per your plan.                 </p>

                If we are not a provider under your insurance plan, you will be responsible for payment in full at the time of service. As a courtesy, however, we will file your initial insurance claim, and if not paid within 45 days, you will be responsible for the total bill. After your insurance company has processed your claims, any amount remaining as a credit balance will be refunded to you.

â¢	If we have verified the claim with your carrier: No payment is necessary at the time of the visit. 
â¢	If we are not able to verify your claim: Your appointment will need to be rescheduled.

â¢	Payment in full is requested at the time of the visit. 	

Our staff will provide a receipt to file the claim with your carrier. 

The patient or the patientâs legal representative is ultimately responsible for all charges for services rendered. âNon-coveredâ means that a service will not be paid for under your insurance plan. If non-covered services are provided, you will be expected to pay for these services at the time they are provided or when you receive a statement or explanation of benefits (EOB) from your insurance provider denying payment. 

Your insurance company offers appeal procedures. We will not under any circumstances falsify or change a diagnosis or symptom to convince an insurer to pay for care that is not covered, nor do we delete or change the content in the record that may prevent services from being considered covered. We cannot offer services without expectation of payment, and if you receive non-covered services, you must agree to pay for these services if your insurance company does not. If you are unsure whether a service is covered by your plan, ultimately, it is your responsibility to call your insurance company to determine what your schedule of benefits allows, if a deductible applies, and your potential financial responsibility.

                Self-pay accounts are used for patients without insurance coverage, patients covered by insurance plans which the office does not accept, or patients without an insurance card on file with us. Liability cases will also be considered self-pay accounts. We do not accept attorney letters or contingency payments. It is always the patientâs responsibility to know if our office is participating in their plan. If there is a discrepancy with our information, the patient will be considered self-pay unless otherwise proven. Self-pay patients will be required to pay in full for services rendered to them and will be asked to make payment arrangements prior to services being rendered. Emergency services provided to self-pay patients will be billed to the patient. 

At the sole discretion of the practice, extended payment arrangements may be made for patients. Please speak with our practice manager to discuss a mutually agreeable payment plan. It is never our intention to cause hardship to our patients, only to provide them with the best care possible and reasonable costs.

                We will bill workersâ compensation for verified claims. It is the patientâs responsibility to provide our office staff with employer authorization and contact information regarding a workersâ compensation claim. If the claim is denied by the workersâ compensation insurance carrier, it then becomes the patientâs responsibility. 

At your request, we will submit the claim to your primary medical insurance carrier with a copy of the workersâ compensation insurance denial. If your primary medical insurance carrierâs claim is denied, you will be responsible for payment in full.

The staff member can answer specific questions about the surgery scheduling process, discuss the paperwork and tests involved, and assist with completing all prior authorization your insurance company might require. 

                Our office will require a pre-surgical deposit equal to the amount of your copayment/deductible to go toward your surgery copayment, deductible, or any other amount your insurance carrier deems to be the patientâs responsibility. After your insurance company has processed your surgery claim, any amount remaining as a credit will be refunded to you.

It is your responsibility to seek reimbursement from them. However, at your request, we will submit a claim to your primary health insurance carrier. You will be asked to pay in full for the services we provide you. All formalities required by your insurer and the third party should be promptly completed by you. If we receive a denial of your claim, you will be responsible for payment in full.               </p>

                As a courtesy to you, we bill your insurance company for services on your behalf.

                It is our office policy that all accounts with pending balances be sent two statements, each one month apart. If payment is not made on the account, a single phone call will be made to try and make payment arrangements. Accounts with unpaid balances for 90 calendar days or more will be sent to an external collection agency or attorney for collection. Unpaid bills can also lead to possible discharge from the practice. 

In the event an account is turned over for collections, the person financially responsible for the account will be responsible for the collections costs, including attorney fees and court costs. 

Regardless of any personal arrangements that a patient might have outside of our office if you are 18 years old or older and receiving treatment, you are ultimately responsible for payment of the service. Our office will not bill any other personal party.

Please understand that to complete forms, your medical record must be reviewed, forms completed and signed by the physician, and copied into your medical record. Some of these forms can be quite complicated and tedious to fill out. Please provide us with pertinent information, especially dates of disability and return to work.

                  If your insurance plan requires a referral authorization from your primary care physician or a pre-authorization from your insurance, you will need to contact your primary care physician or insurance company to be sure it has been obtained. If we have yet to receive authorization prior to your appointment time, we will reschedule.. Failure to obtain the referral or preauthorization may result in a lower or no payment from the insurance company, and the balance will become the patientâs responsibility.

                <p className="mb-4">
                Insurance is a contract between you and your insurance company. In most cases, we are not a party to this contract. We will bill your primary insurance company on your behalf as a courtesy to you. To properly bill your insurance company, we require that you disclose all insurance information, including primary and secondary insurance, as well as any change of insurance information. 

It is your responsibility to notify our office promptly of any patient information changes (ie, address, name, insurance information) to facilitate appropriate billing for the services rendered to you. Failure to provide complete and accurate insurance information may result in the entire bill being categorized as a patientâs responsibility. 

Although we may estimate what your insurance company may pay, it is the insurance company that makes the final determination of your eligibility and benefits. If your insurance company is not contracted with us, you agree to pay any portion of the charges not covered by insurance, including but not limited to those charges above the usual and customary allowance. If we are out of network for your insurance company and your insurance pays you directly, you are responsible for payment and agree to forward the payment to us immediately.

                Cary Physicians Primary Care PLLC accepts most major insurance plans.

Our staff will provide a receipt to file the claim with your carrier. 

The patient or the patientâs legal representative is ultimately responsible for all charges for services rendered. âNon-coveredâ means that a service will not be paid for under your insurance plan. If non-covered services are provided, you will be expected to pay for these services at the time they are provided or when you receive a statement or explanation of benefits (EOB) from your insurance provider denying payment. 

Your insurance company offers appeal procedures. We will not under any circumstances falsify or change a diagnosis or symptom to convince an insurer to pay for care that is not covered, nor do we delete or change the content in the record that may prevent services from being considered covered. We cannot offer services without expectation of payment, and if you receive non-covered services, you must agree to pay for these services if your insurance company does not. If you are unsure whether a service is covered by your plan, ultimately, it is your responsibility to call your insurance company to determine what your schedule of benefits allows, if a deductible applies, and your potential financial responsibility.

                <p className="mb-4">

                Self-pay accounts are used for patients without insurance coverage, patients covered by insurance plans which the office does not accept, or patients without an insurance card on file with us. Liability cases will also be considered self-pay accounts. We do not accept attorney letters or contingency payments. It is always the patientâs responsibility to know if our office is participating in their plan. If there is a discrepancy with our information, the patient will be considered self-pay unless otherwise proven. Self-pay patients will be required to pay in full for services rendered to them and will be asked to make payment arrangements prior to services being rendered. Emergency services provided to self-pay patients will be billed to the patient. 

At the sole discretion of the practice, extended payment arrangements may be made for patients. Please speak with our practice manager to discuss a mutually agreeable payment plan. It is never our intention to cause hardship to our patients, only to provide them with the best care possible and reasonable costs.

                We will bill workersâ compensation for verified claims. It is the patientâs responsibility to provide our office staff with employer authorization and contact information regarding a workersâ compensation claim. If the claim is denied by the workersâ compensation insurance carrier, it then becomes the patientâs responsibility. 

At your request, we will submit the claim to your primary medical insurance carrier with a copy of the workersâ compensation insurance denial. If your primary medical insurance carrierâs claim is denied, you will be responsible for payment in full.

The staff member can answer specific questions about the surgery scheduling process, discuss the paperwork and tests involved, and assist with completing all prior authorization your insurance company might require. 

                Our office will require a pre-surgical deposit equal to the amount of your copayment/deductible to go toward your surgery copayment, deductible, or any other amount your insurance carrier deems to be the patientâs responsibility. After your insurance company has processed your surgery claim, any amount remaining as a credit will be refunded to you.

                It is our office policy that all accounts with pending balances be sent two statements, each one month apart. If payment is not made on the account, a single phone call will be made to try and make payment arrangements. Accounts with unpaid balances for 90 calendar days or more will be sent to an external collection agency or attorney for collection. Unpaid bills can also lead to possible discharge from the practice. 

In the event an account is turned over for collections, the person financially responsible for the account will be responsible for the collections costs, including attorney fees and court costs. 

Regardless of any personal arrangements that a patient might have outside of our office if you are 18 years old or older and receiving treatment, you are ultimately responsible for payment of the service. Our office will not bill any other personal party.
