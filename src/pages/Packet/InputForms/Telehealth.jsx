        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What is telehealth?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Telemedicine, also referred to as telehealth medicine, is the real-time,
          audio-visual visit between a provider and patient. It can be used as an
          alternative to traditional in-person care delivery and, in certain
          circumstances, can be used to deliver care including the diagnosis,
          consultation, treatment, education, care management and patient
          self-management.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">How do I use telehealth?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You talk to your provider with a phone, computer or tablet. Sometimes,
          you use video so you and your provider can see each other.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">How does telehealth help me?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You don't have to go to a clinic or hospital to see your provider. It
          also reduces your risk of getting sick from other people.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What are some of the benefits of telehealth?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          No transportation time or costs, reduced wait time, and more detailed
          and personalized care compared to a telephone call.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What are some of the challenges of telehealth visits?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You and your provider won't be in the same room, so it may feel
          different from an office visit. Your provider cannot examine you as
          closely as they might at an in-office visit. Your provider may decide
          you still need an office visit. Technical problems may interrupt or stop
          your visit before you are done.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Will my telehealth visit be private?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We will not record visits with your provider. If people are close to
          you, they may hear something you do not want them to know. You should be
          in a private place so other people cannot hear you. Your provider will
          tell you if someone else from their office can hear or see you. We use
          HIPAA-compliant, encrypted telehealth technology that is designed to
          protect your privacy. If you use the internet for telehealth, use a
          network that is private and secure. There is a very small chance that
          someone could use technology to hear or see your telehealth visit.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What types of visits can telehealth be used for?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Telehealth is best suited for interactions with established patients who
          do not require a physical exam or lab work.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What types of visits are not appropriate for telehealth?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Telehealth is not suited for a physical examination or lab testing, and
          cannot be used for new-patient evaluations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What if I want an office visit, not a telehealth visit?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          That decision is up to you and your provider. Find out what options are
          available to you by calling the practice.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">What if I try telehealth and don't like it?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          You can stop using telehealth any time, even during a telehealth visit.
          You can still get an office visit if you no longer want a telehealth
          visit. If you decide you do not want to use telehealth again, call
          <strong> (919) 230-7439 </strong> and say you want to stop, or sign into your patient
          portal and <strong>eClinicalWorks/ Healow.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">How much does a telehealth visit cost?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          What you pay depends on your insurance. If your provider decides you
          need an office visit in addition to your telehealth visit, you may have
          to pay for both visits.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className="mb-6">
        <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Do I have to sign this document?</h2>

          No. Only sign this document if you want to use telehealth.
